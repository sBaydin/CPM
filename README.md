Finding Critic Path with Predecessor - (CPM)

I am currently working on an optimization problem. I am still new to coding. I am currently working on a code for the project I have.

One of the steps of this project is CPM management, which calculates the critical path in the project. Accordingly, it also calculates the values of Early Start, Early Finish, Late Start, Late Finish, Total Slack, Free Slack.

The program takes the data from excel file. 

I put the Excel file as an attachment. You can use it as a template and you can experiment with it. But if you enter a different column name because I have defined the column names in the program, it will give an error.

Known failures:

It makes errors in some of the Free abundance values when calculating. I would appreciate if there are friends who can help me with this issue.
